# jupyter_projects
Files from that repository represent my first data analysis projects that were started as guided projects on the learning site dataquest.io.
Datasets that I use for these projects were shared at that site as learning material.
I use Jupyter Notebook files for these project, Python 3.9 as core programming language and following libraries: Datetime, csv, Pandas, Numpy

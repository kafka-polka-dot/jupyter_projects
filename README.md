# Introduction

As a aspiring Data Analyst I am interested in building my hard coding skills necessary for data projects: collecting, processing, and visualizing data. A starting point for these data analysis projects were learning materials from the platform dataquest.io.


## Libraries 

 - geopandas-0.9.0
 - jupyter-1.0.0
 - matplotlib-3.3.4
 - numpy-1.19.5
 - pandas-1.2.0
 - seaborn-0.11.1
 - wordcloud-1.8.1

# Projects
## [Performance Gap in NYC High Schools: is school education still segregated?](https://github.com/kafka-polka-dot/jupyter_projects/blob/main/SAT_scores/SAT_scores_analysis.ipynb)
In the course of that project I explore the factors that contribute to a high academic performance in the New York City public schools using a number of  data sets. That project includes extensive data preparation and exploratory analysis using a wide range of visualisation techniques including geographic data. 
I examined ways to assess academic performance, environmental and demographic factors of it. Academic performance varies greatly across New York City’s public high schools. Achievement gap exists between Hispanic, black students on one side and white, asian students on the other side. The reasons for that are mainly social: low SAT scores correlate with low income and probably also poor English competence that is widespread among fresh migrant families.

## [Employee Turnover: Analyzing Exit Surveys](https://github.com/kafka-polka-dot/jupyter_projects/tree/main/exit_surveys)
In this project  I sought to answer the question about age and working experience of people who resigned because of dissatisfaction. I worked with surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. The project required extensive data cleaning and formatting and extra insides from developmental psychology.
I came to the conclusion that more experienced employees with older age resign more often and formulated some recommendations to the HR department.


## [Exploring Popular Data Science Questions On Stack Exchange](https://github.com/kafka-polka-dot/jupyter_projects/blob/main/ds_questions/ds_questions.ipynb)
Imagine you are building a curriculum for an e-learning platform. You’d like to know what topics  are popular among people who learn Data Science. The perfect place to ask these questions is a database of Data Science Stack Exchange. Using SQL queries to get valuable information on every post in that community I further analysed the most popular tags and found out that there is a  growing interest in deep learning tools especially natural speech processing and computer vision.

## [Finding markets and optimal pricing policy for e-learning platform](https://github.com/kafka-polka-dot/jupyter_projects/blob/main/ds_questions/target.ipynb)
For that project I was willing to target a marketing campaign for an e-learning company that offers courses on programming. My task was to identify countries with the highest number of coding learners and find out how much money they are willing to pay for learning. 

## ["You shall not pass!", or Building the Spam Filter Algorithm using Naive Bayes](https://github.com/kafka-polka-dot/jupyter_projects/blob/main/spam_filter/filter_bayes.ipynb)
For that learning project I built a spam filter specifically directed at preventing mobile phone spam using an algorithm based on Bayes' theorem called Naive Bayes.

## [Visual Analysis Basics: Visualize Earnings Based on College Majors with Maplotlib and Seaborn](https://github.com/kafka-polka-dot/jupyter_projects/blob/main/visualize_majors/College_majors.ipynb)
College_majors - That project is more about finding out better approaches to visual analysis that unites data exploration and data visualization. My aim was to present how differ earnings are among graduates of different majors in the USA. I found out that despite the certain gender equality in some areas (at least at this level of granularity) among alumni of a number of majors (e.g. Business majors) there is still a large imbalance between “male” and “female” domains with latter correlated to lower earnings, larger shares of part-time and low-wage jobs.

## Varia

### [Visualizing gender gap in bachelor degrees in the USA](https://github.com/kafka-polka-dot/jupyter_projects/tree/main/gender_gap_bachelors)
How to visualize long-term trends in gender gap across bachelor degrees? Here I experimented with a ‘small multiple’ format and created simple yet informative line charts.

### [Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets](https://github.com/kafka-polka-dot/jupyter_projects/blob/main/app_stats/app_market.ipynb)
In the project I analyse data scraped from App Store and Google Play Market to identify the most popular categories of applications on both platforms. I identified that genres of Books & Reference for Google Play Store and Reference for App Store attract a lot of users but are not massively dominated by few leaders. My final recommendation is to build some applications based around a niche but commonly used text.

### [What Posts on Hacker News Attract More Attention](https://github.com/kafka-polka-dot/jupyter_projects/blob/main/hacker_news/hacker_news.ipynb)
In the course of that straight-forward project I identified that questions asked on Hacker News attract more comments on average than informative posts and found out the time period when posts tend to get more attention.

### [Exploring Ebay Car Sales Data](https://github.com/kafka-polka-dot/jupyter_projects/blob/main/ebay_cars/Autos.ipynb)
Project to practice data cleaning and basic exploration skills

### [Fandango Movie Ratings: What Has Changed after the Bias Accusations](https://github.com/kafka-polka-dot/jupyter_projects/blob/main/Fandango/fandango_ratings.ipynb)
I have proved that after the movie-ratings aggregator Fandango was accused of bias for popular movies in 2015 the next year ratings for fresh releases were lower on average.

    "# Fandango Movie Ratings: What Has Changed after the Bias Accusations\n",
    "\n",
    "Online movie ratings aggregators have recently become extremely popular. Top of them are: [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/), [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/) and [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/), each one having a unique way of aggregating film ratings and reviews. Many of these systems calculate [an approximate average assessment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_aggregator), usually based on assigning a numeric value to each review related to its degree of positive rating of the work. Since aggregated scores can easily be a decisive factor for the choice in favor of one or another film, thus influencing sales, the question of *how objectively they are calculated* becomes relevant. More than that Fandango has an immediate interest in customers' choice: the website directly sells tickets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In October 2015, a data journalist named **Walt Hickey** analyzed movie ratings data from another online movie ratings aggregator **Fandango** and found enough evidence to suggest that Fandango's rating system was biased. He published his analysis [in this article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/).\n",
    "\n",
    "On their website Fandango displays a 5-star rating system, with the minimum rating being 0 stars and the maximum 5 stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hickey found that there's a significant inconsistency between the rating showed to users and the actual rating, which could be found in the HTML of the page. \n",
    "\n",
    "He was able to find that:\n",
    "\n",
    " - The actual rating was almost always rounded up to the nearest half-star. For instance, a 4.1 movie would be rounded off to 4.5 stars, not to 4 stars, as you may expect.\n",
    " - In the case of 8% of the ratings analyzed, the rounding up was done to the nearest whole star. For instance, a 4.5 rating would be rounded off to 5 stars.\n",
    " - For one movie rating, the rounding off was completely bizarre: from a rating of 4 in the HTML of the page to a displayed rating of 5 stars.\n",
    " \n",
    "After Hickey sent a request to Fandango's officials they replied that the bias in rounding was caused by a bug in their system. They promised to fix it as soon as possible. We can't check if that has happened in the same way as the author of the article  found that bug out since the actual rating value doesn't seem to be displayed anymore in the pages' HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project my aim is to **analyze more recent movie ratings data to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Walt Hickey made the data he analyzed publicly available [on GitHub](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fandango). I'll use this data to analyze the characteristics of Fandango's rating system previous to his analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of Dataquest's team members collected movie ratings data for movies released in 2016 and 2017. The data is publicly available [on GitHub](https://github.com/mircealex/Movie_ratings_2016_17) and I'll use it as a reference for the rating system's characteristics after Hickey's analysis."

    "## What is the target population?\n",
    "\n",
    "`fandango_score_comparison.csv` contains every film that has a Rotten Tomatoes rating, a Metacritic score, a Metacritic User score, and IMDb score, and *at least 30* reviews on Fandango. The data from Fandango was pulled on Aug. 24, 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "`movie_ratings_16_17.csv` contains movie ratings data for 214 of the most popular movies (with a significant number of votes) released in 2016 and 2017. As of March 22, 2017, the ratings were up to date. Significant changes in ratings since that time period could happen mostly for movies released in 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "## Changed goal of the analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets represent data on the most popular films. The sampling process was not random, so it can only represent information about **most popular films**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the new goal, I will choose two populations to describe and compare with each other:\n",
    "\n",
    " - All Fandango's ratings for popular movies released in 2015.\n",
    " - All Fandango's ratings for popular movies released in 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"popular\" is vague and needs to be more precise. I’ll use Hickey's benchmark and consider a movie as \"popular\" only if it has 30 reviews or more on Fandango website.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Isolating the Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Although one of the sampling criteria in our second sample is movie popularity, the sample doesn't provide information about the number of fan ratings. We should be skeptical once more and ask whether this sample is truly representative and contains popular movies (movies with over 30 fan ratings).\n",
    "\n",
    "One quick way to check the representativity of this sample is to sample randomly 10 movies from it and then check the number of fan ratings ourselves on Fandango's website. Ideally, at least 8 out of the 10 movies have 30 fan ratings or more."
